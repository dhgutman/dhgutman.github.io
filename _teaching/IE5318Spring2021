Nonlinear programming has become a fundamental toolset in modern operations research and
data science. With exceedingly few exceptions, the training of any statistical/machine learning
model requires solving a large-scale, highly nonlinear (and often non-convex) optimization
problem. This course provides an introduction to the theory of nonlinear optimization. We will
cover the common analytical tools for nonlinear programming, local duality theory and KKT
multipliers for general nonlinear programs, global duality for convex programs, efficiency of
convex programs, and iconic algorithms for solving these problems. Time permitting, we will
cover basic integer programming theory.
