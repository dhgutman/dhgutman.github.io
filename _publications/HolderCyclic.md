*With Nam Ho-Nguyen (University of Sydney, Discipline of Business Analytics)*

We provide a convergence analysis of cyclic block coordinate descent under Hölder smoothness assumptions. We consider both convex and non-convex objectives, obtaining a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(p/k^\gamma\right)$ to the optimal value for convex objectives and a rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(p^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma}}/k^{\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}}\right)$ to a stationary point for non-convex objectives, where $\gamma$ is the Hölder exponent. These rates recover those obtained in existing literature for full gradient descent and/or when the objective is simply Lipschitz smooth.
