We show that the iterates generated by a generic first-order meta-algorithm satisfy a canonical perturbed Fenchel duality inequality. The latter in turn 
readily yields a unified derivation of the best known convergence rates for various popular first-order algorithms including the conditional gradient 
method as well as the main kinds of Bregman proximal methods: subgradient, gradient, fast gradient, and universal gradient methods.
